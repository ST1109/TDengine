### Configuring taosAdapter

To configure taosAdapter to receive icinga2 data.

- Enable the configuration item in the taosAdapter configuration file (default location /etc/taos/taosadapter.toml)

```
...
[opentsdb_telnet]
enable = true
maxTCPConnections = 250
tcpKeepAlive = false
dbs = ["opentsdb_telnet", "collectd", "icinga2", "tcollector"]
ports = [6046, 6047, 6048, 6049]
user = "root"
password = "taosdata"
...
```

The default database name written by the taosAdapter is `icinga2`. You can also modify the taosAdapter configuration file dbs entry to specify a different name. user and password are the values configured by the actual TDengine. You need to restart the taosAdapter after modification.

- You can also enable taosAdapter to receive icinga2 data by using the taosAdapter command-line parameters or setting environment variables.

### Configure icinga3

- Enable opentsdb-writer for icinga2 (refer to the link https://icinga.com/docs/icinga-2/latest/doc/14-features/#opentsdb-writer)
- Modify the configuration file `/etc/icinga2/features-enabled/opentsdb.conf` by filling in <taosAdapter's host\> as the domain name or IP address of the server running taosAdapter and <port for icinga2\> as the corresponding port on which taosAdapter supports receiving icinga2 data (default is 6048)

```
object OpenTsdbWriter "opentsdb" {
  host = "<taosAdapter's host>"
  port = <port for icinga2>
}
```

Example file:

```
object OpenTsdbWriter "opentsdb" {
  host = "127.0.0.1"
  port = 6048
}
```
